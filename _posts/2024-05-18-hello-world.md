# Welcome to My DevOps Journey

Hello and welcome to my blog! Here, I'll be sharing my experiences and insights as I transition into a DevOps Engineer. This journey is both challenging and exciting, and I hope you'll join me as I navigate through it.

## My Starting Point

I'm currently following a fantastic tutorial on Udemy called [Decoding DevOps](https://www.udemy.com/course/decodingdevops/). This course is providing me with a solid foundation and practical knowledge in the DevOps field.

## My Background

I have a diverse background in the tech industry. I started my career as a Frontend Developer, where I honed my skills in creating user interfaces. After some time, I transitioned to an SAP Support position. Here, I learned ABAP programming, which became invaluable in my subsequent role as an SAP Developer.

Over the past few years, I've ventured into Agile coaching. In this role, I helped teams improve their processes and achieve better efficiency. While I enjoyed this work, I found myself missing the hands-on technical challenges. That's when I decided to pivot my career towards DevOps.

## Why DevOps?

DevOps fascinates me because it encompasses a wide range of technologies and practices. It demands continuous learning and adaptation, which aligns perfectly with my passion for technology and problem-solving. DevOps professionals bridge the gap between development and operations, ensuring smooth and efficient software delivery. This dynamic field requires a deep understanding of both software development and IT operations, making it an ideal next step for me.

## What to Expect

As I embark on this new path, I'll be documenting my progress, sharing what I learn, and offering tips and insights along the way. Whether you're a seasoned professional or just starting out, I hope my experiences can provide value and inspiration.

Stay tuned for updates, tutorials, and more as I dive deeper into the world of DevOps. Let's learn and grow together!
