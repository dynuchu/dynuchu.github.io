# About Me

Hi, I'm Agnes Bosskay, and welcome to my blog! 

I have a diverse background in the tech industry, starting as a Frontend Developer and then transitioning into SAP Support, where I learned ABAP programming. I later became an SAP Developer.

For the past few years, I've worked as an Agile coach, helping teams improve their processes and efficiency. However, I missed the technical challenges, which led me to pursue a career in DevOps.

I'm currently following a comprehensive tutorial on Udemy called [Decoding DevOps](https://www.udemy.com/course/decodingdevops/), which is helping me build a solid foundation in this field.

This blog is where I document my journey, share my learnings, and offer tips and insights about DevOps. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced professional, I hope you'll find something valuable here.
